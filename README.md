1. Steps to configure Hub




2.  Steps to configure Switch




3. Steps to Configure Router

set IP address for the PC0  -- 192.168.1.10
Set different IP for the Server -- 172.16.1.1
Connect PC0, Switch, and Server with Fast ethernet port and wire
Connect Switch and ROuter ith Gigabit ethernet port.
Set IP for the router on both port, one for the PC0 (192.168.1.1) and other port for the Server(172.16.1.1)
Click on port checkbox to enable the ports.
Now we have to set up the default gateway for the PC and Server
Navigate to the settings in PC and Server and setyp the default gateway as Router's IP for each port.
For PC0 - 192.168.1.1 and for the server 172.16.1.1

Now ping Server IP from PC it will work fine.

I have created a document to find the imposter with out looking in the PC. we have mac address list and running few commands int he Switch and finding the malicious PC.
